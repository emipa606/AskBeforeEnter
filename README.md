Sometimes that trader caravan enters just at the wrong time, triggering the dormant mech cluster leading to the premature destruction of your base. 

This mod shows a message as a trade caravan approches where you can tell them to not enter.
You can also tell them to come back later, they will then return in about 6 hours.
This also triggers for visitor-groups and travelers passing through your map.

You can select what groups to trigger for in the mod-options.

Works well as a companion mod for [Enter Here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824117092)
