Sometimes that trader caravan enters just at the wrong time, triggering the dormant mech cluster leading to the premature destruction of your base. 

This mod shows a message as a trade caravan approches where you can tell them to not enter.
You can also tell them to come back later, they will then return in about 6 hours.
